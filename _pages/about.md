I enjoy helping things to ferment.

I've experimented with lots of fermentation techniques - I've used yeast to make a lot of bread and some award-winning beers, but I've also made more experimental ferments like soy sauce, miso, kombucha and more.

This blog is a place for me to record my experiments and what I cooked with the successful ferments. Hopefully other fermentation fans will find this useful.
